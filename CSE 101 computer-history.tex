\section{Introduction}
Supercomputers are some of the most intricate, complex, and utterly awe-inspiring technological marvels that human kind has ever created. With the ability to preform millions of calculations in a matter of seconds, these machines have greatly advanced the human understanding of science. Using multiple powerful CPU's, a supercomputer sends signals within itself at almost the speed of light, with the fastest performing a massive 442 quadrillion (4.42x10^15) Floating-Point-Operations per Second (FLOPS). By comparison, a standard household computer can only process at a speed of 2.8 billion (2.8x10^9) Operations per Second.

\section{Time Period}
The concept of a supercomputer has existed for a remarkably long time in relation to computer history. In 1964, Seymoore Cray was credited for building the Control Data Corperation's CDC 6600, after a brief competitionwith IBM to build an extremely fast computer. This was the first computer to be dubbed as a supercomputer, with the ability to perform three million FLOPS. After 57 years of improvement, the official recordholder for the world's fastest supercomputer is Fujitsu Global's Fugaku Supercomputer, which was launched in 2021, with a processing speed of 442 quadrillion (4.42x10^15) Floating-Point-Operations per Second (FLOPS). Research still continues to this day as to how to increase the speed of these computers but are being controled by the limitation that data cannot be transfered at a speed above the speed of light.

\section{Computer Hardware}
Describe the type of hardware that was used for your chosen topic.

Here, Figure \ref{fig:gpu} has been included so you have some code to use and update.
